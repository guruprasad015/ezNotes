ezNotes
=======

a simple to use, cloud based, note making app where performance and simplicity come first, then comes everything else

This is not even version 1 hence calling it version 0.1. 
Just an initial set up and the very skeleton of the intended app.
The dream and the intentions will be shared in some time.

tl;dr: Have a super simple, command based, cloud syncd, responsive web app for note taking.
Must be able to handle entire app without touching mouse! like a unix terminal.
