ezNotes
=======

A simple to use, cloud based, note making app where performance and simplicity come first, then comes everything else.

Access it <a href="harshabhat86.github.io">here</a>.
URL is <a href="harshabhat86.github.io">harshabhat86.github.io</a>.


This is not even version 1 hence calling it version 0.1. 
Just an initial set up and the very skeleton of the intended app.
The dream and the intentions will be shared in some time.

tl;dr: Have a super simple, command based, cloud syncd, responsive web app for note taking.
Must be able to handle entire app without touching mouse! like a unix terminal.

<b>Support for Hashtags </b>
Each note can have hashtags in it. And the hashtags will be highlighed in blue color.
Well, for all the people who do not know what a hashtag is , any word after a # is a hashtag.
Ex: #hi is a hashtag #hello_world is a hashtag too. "#hello world" is not a hashtag.



<b>Dream</b>
1) This app should support all the note making and note related activities without any use of mouse / trackpad.
2) Performance should be blazing fast.
3) Should adjust to all the form factors (laptop, mobile, tablet)
4) Login integrated with most of the OAuth providers.
